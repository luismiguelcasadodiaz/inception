# Increase hard disk space in an existing virtual machine
 
As the project progressed, I realised that the original 2GB disk was insufficient. Early on, Docker Compose began reporting the error: no space left on device.

To resolve this, I doubled the disk size using the following commands.

```bash
VBoxManage modifymedium disk "/sgoinfre/students/luicasad/maria/maria/inception Clone.vdi" --resize 4096
VBoxManage showhdinfo "/sgoinfre/students/luicasad/maria/maria/inception Clone.vdi"
```

This involves modifying the partition table of the virtual machine. Within `fdisk /dev/sda`, I deleted the 3rd partition without erasing data with `-d`.

This involves a file system extension. `resize2fs /dev/sda3` made it possible.

# Shared folders

This setup enables me to use Visual Studio Code on the host machine to seamlessly edit files within the virtual machine.

The mounted shared folder in the virtual machine gets ownership root:vboxsf, no matter how you configure fstab.

You're absolutely right â€” and this is a known limitation of vboxsf (VirtualBox Shared Folders):

Even with uid= and gid= options in /etc/fstab, vboxsf mounts are always owned by root:vboxsf, and Alpine (or other Linux guests) can't force a change in that ownership.

This is not a bug in Alpine, but a design limitation of the VirtualBox shared folder driver.

Share folders are available with the help of `virtualbox-guest-additions`. I shall execute virtualbox-guest-additions before Docker.

# Increase hard disk space in an existing virtual machine
 
As long as I advanced in the project, I discovered that the original 2GB disk was not enough. Early in the project docker compose reported `no space left on device`.

I duplicated the hard disk size with these commands

```bash
VBoxManage modifymedium disk "/sgoinfre/students/luicasad/maria/maria/inception Clone.vdi" --resize 4096
VBoxManage showhdinfo "/sgoinfre/students/luicasad/maria/maria/inception Clone.vdi"
```

That requires the edition of the virtual machine partition table. With `fdisk /dev/sda` deleted 3rd partition `-d` without erase data.

That requires a file system extension. `resize2fs /dev/sda3` made it possible.

# Shared folders

This mechanism allows me to edit from the host machine, using Visual Studio code, inside the virtual machine.

The mounted shared folder in the virtual machine gets ownership root:vboxsf, no mater how you configure fstab

You're absolutely right â€” and this is a known limitation of vboxsf (VirtualBox Shared Folders):

Even with uid= and gid= options in /etc/fstab, vboxsf mounts are always owned by root:vboxsf, and Alpine (or other Linux guests) can't force change that ownership.

This is not a bug in Alpine, but a design limitation of the VirtualBox shared folder driver.

# Version

I use an Alpine linux version with an slimmed down kernel. Optimized for virtual systems.[Named virtual ](https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.21/releases/x86_64/alpine-virt-3.21.3-x86_64.iso)

It is a volatil version designe to exist only in RAM. Running setup you MUST make file sustem persistent

# Login
User root has no password. FIX this at setup.

# setup-alpine
This is the script to configure Alpine linux
+ select keyboar map: us us ---> to fit with 42 Mac keyboards

# /etc/fstab

Configure automount the shared folder between host machine and virtual machine. Add this line

```bash
inception_host	/home/luicasad/inception_host	vboxsf	defaults	0	0
or
inception  /home/luicasad vboxsf user,uid=101177,gid=4223,rw,auto 0 0

```

You're absolutely right â€” and this is a known limitation of vboxsf (VirtualBox Shared Folders):

Even with uid= and gid= options in /etc/fstab, vboxsf mounts are always owned by root:vboxsf, and Alpine (or other Linux guests) can't force change that ownership.

This is not a bug in Alpine, but a design limitation of the VirtualBox shared folder driver.

# add new user

I want that my user luicasad in the virtual machine has the same uid/gid that the ones I have in my host machine. This will help me later to push changes from virtual machine to my repositories

```bash
id luicasad
uid=101177(luicasad) gid=4223(2023_barcelona) groups=204(_developer),4223(2023_barcelona)
```


```sh
addgroup -g 4223 2023_barcelona
adduser -u 101177 -G 2023_barcelona -D luicasad
adduser luicasad docker
```

# install required packages

apk add git
apk add make
apk add jq
apk add docker
apk add docker-compose






# docker wakes up at boot time
```sh
rc-update add docker boot
rd-service docker start
```

# init swarm service for secrets

```sh
docker swarm init
```

# allow my user to run docker
```sh
adduser luicasad docker
```

# keys

Copy you id_rsa key from your 42 school home directory to work wiht the delivery repository

# /bin/sh



On Alpine Linux, /bin/sh is usually a POSIX shell (ash), which does not support ${!var}, a `indirect parameter expansion`. 
The indirect parameter expansion is a bash feature.

My db container entrypoint script gave me an error `line 77: syntax error: bad substitution`


```sh
set_mysql_password() {
    local username="$1"
    local file_var="$2"
    local env_var="$3"

    local password=$(read_secret "${!file_var}")  <<======>>
    echo "user =$username"
    echo "file =$file_var"
    echo "envi =$env_var"
    echo "pass =$password"
```

i solved it like this

```sh
    local password=$(read_secret "$file_var")
```

# configure /etc/hosts

Inception subject says: 

+ You must configure your **domain name to point to your local IP address**. This domain name must be luicasad.42.fr.

Despite that Alpine Linux has a `setup-hostname` command, the result does not affects /etc/hosts

```bash
/ # setup-hostname 
Enter system hostname (fully qualified form, e.g. 'foo.example.org') [luicasad.42.fr] 
/ # cat /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1	luicasad.42barcelona.com luicasad localhost.localdomain localhost
::1		localhost localhost.localdomain
/ # 
```

Additionally the network interface i work with in the Oracle VirtualBox is bridge, so my VM gets its IP dynamically from 42's DHCP.

I ask at booting time to update `/etc/hosts` with the current ip running `/etc/local.d/update_hosts.start`
